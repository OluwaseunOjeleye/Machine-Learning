# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms I implemented from scratch using Python and C++.

Algorithms implemented from scratch till date:

1. **[Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/ANN)**: implemented with C++.

2. **[KNN Classifier](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/KNN%20Classifier)**: implemented with Python.

3. **[KNN Regression](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/KNN%20Regression)**: implemented with Python.

4. **[Linear Support Vector Machine(SVM)](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Linear%20SVM)**: implemented with Python.

5. **[Linear and Non-Linear SVM](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Linear%20and%20NonLinear%20SVM)**: implemented with Python.

6. **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression)**: implemented with Python.

The machine learning algorithms implementations were used to work on machine learning projects such as:

1. Iris flowers classification

2. Breast cancer detection

3. Boston house prices prediction with regression, etc.
